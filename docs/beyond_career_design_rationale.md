Beyond Career - Documentation Package
1. Design Rationale Document
Design Philosophy
The Beyond Career website embraces a modern, premium aesthetic that reflects innovation and professionalism. The design prioritizes emotional engagement through dynamic visuals, smooth animations, and contemporary styling that makes users stop and say "whoa."
Color Scheme Decisions
•	Primary Gradient (Purple-Blue): #667eea to #764ba2 - Conveys trust, innovation, and professionalism
•	Secondary Gradient (Pink-Red): #f093fb to #f5576c - Adds energy and vibrancy for call-to-action elements
•	Accent Gradient (Blue-Cyan): #4facfe to #00f2fe - Creates visual hierarchy and highlights key features
•	Dark Gradient: #1a1a2e to #16213e - Provides sophisticated contrast and premium feel
Typography Strategy
Inter font family chosen for its exceptional readability, modern appearance, and versatility across all screen sizes. Weight variations (300-800) create clear visual hierarchy while maintaining consistency.
User Experience Considerations
•	Glass morphism effects create depth and modern appeal
•	Floating animations add life and interactivity
•	Smooth scroll behavior enhances navigation flow
•	Progressive disclosure through sectioned content prevents overwhelming users
